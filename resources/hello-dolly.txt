Dolly, hello, Harry, well, hello Louie
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You're looking swell, Manny, I can tell, Danny

You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong
For the band's playin' one of my old favorite songs
From way back when
So bridge that gap, fellas, find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll, never go away again

Hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're looking swell, Dolly, we can tell, Dolly

You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong, we feel the room swayin'
For the band's playin' one of your old fav'rite songs
From 'way back when

So, here's my hat fellas
I'm stayin' where I'm at, fellas
Promise you'll never go away again

I went away from the lights of Fourteenth Street
And into my personal haze
But now that I'm back in the lights of l4th Street
Tomorrow will be brighter than the good old days
Those good old days

Hello, well, hello Dolly
Well hello, hey, look there's Dolly
Glad to see you Hank, let's thank my lucky star
Your lucky star, you're lookin' great, Stanley
Lose some weight, Stanley?

Dolly's overjoyed and overwhelmed and over par
I hear the ice tinkle, see the lights twinkle
And you still get glances from us handsome men, so
Golly gee, fellas, find me a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly'll, never go away again

Well, well, hello Dolly
Well, hello Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly, we can tell, Dolly

You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong, I hear the ice tinkle
See the lights twinkle
And you still get glances from us handsome men, so

Wow, wow, wow, fellas
Hey, yeah, look at the old girl now, fellas, wow
Dolly'll, never go away again
